# Fluent Edge

Fluent Edge is a Flask-based web application that records live audio, transcribes it using Vosk, restores punctuation, checks grammar using LanguageTool, and calculates accuracy. The transcription and analysis results are displayed in real-time on the frontend.

## Dependencies
The project has the following dependencies:

- **Flask**: A web framework used for the frontend and backend integration.
- **language-tool-python**: A library for grammar checking using LanguageTool.
- **numpy**: A numerical computation library used in audio processing.
- **sounddevice**: A library used for audio recording.
- **vosk**: A speech recognition toolkit for transcribing audio.
- **pytest**: A testing framework to run unit tests.

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Starting the Flask Application:
To start the Flask web server, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Recording Audio:
Once the app is running, click the "Start" button to begin recording audio. The app will transcribe the speech and display the results (including punctuation restoration and grammar check).

### Transcription and Analysis:
After speech is recorded, the transcription, grammar errors, and punctuation-restored text will be displayed in real-time.

### Accuracy Calculation:
The app calculates the accuracy of the transcription by comparing the detected grammar errors with the total number of words in the transcription.

## Running the Application
1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Fluent_Edge
    ```

2. Start the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the app.

## Testing
To run unit tests for the application, use the `pytest` framework. This will run all the tests in the `Testing/` folder.

```bash
pytest
```

You can run specific tests as well, for example:

```bash
pytest Testing/accuracy_test.py
```

### Available Test Files:
- **accuracy_test.py**: Tests the accuracy calculation logic.
- **app_test.py**: Tests the Flask app's routes and functionality.
- **audio_test.py**: Tests the audio handling functionality (e.g., recording and Vosk integration).
- **error_logging_test.py**: Tests the logging functionality during errors.
- **grammar_test.py**: Tests the grammar checker functionality.
- **integration_test.py**: Tests the integration of all components.
- **mic_test.py**: Tests the microphone input handling.
- **punctuation_test.py**: Tests punctuation restoration.
- **vosk_test.py**: Tests Vosk speech recognition models.
